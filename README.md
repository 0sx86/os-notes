### Intel Processor Execution Modes

![](imgs/20241117000054.png)


- **Real Mode**:
This mode implements the programming environment of the Intel 8086 processor with extensions (such as the ability to switch to protected or system management mode). The processor is placed in real-address mode following power-up or a reset.

No virtual memory, no privilege rings, 16 but mode. For example, DOS runs in real mode.
If we reset our processor, it is going to go back into real mode. So everything always starts in real mode every time we power on and power off the processor.
It is the job of the BIOS to get us out of real mode as soon as possible.

=> For more informations, let's see : [Architecture 4021: Introduction UEFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgGwqG1Fiao&list=PLUFkSN0XLZ-ltETI20mpXOCdqC8rdven6)


- **Protected Mode:**
This mode is the native state of the processor. Among the capabilities of protected mode
is the ability to directly execute “real-address mode” 8086 software in a protected, multi-tasking environment. This feature is called virtual-8086 mode, although it is not actually a processor mode. Virtual-8086 mode is actually a protected mode attribute that can be enabled for any task.


- **System management mode (SMM):**
This mode provides an operating system or executive with a transparent mechanism for implementing platform-specific functions such as power management and system security. The processor enters SMM when the external SMM interrupt pin (SMI#) is activated or an SMI is received from the advanced programmable interrupt controller (APIC).


### CPUID

WIP

### Model Specific Registers (MSRs)
The mnemonic cpuid is the way that software finds out what features are supported, but how to enable it ?
=> MSRs provide a way on Intel systems to support an number of feature flags. The list is so big that Intel eventuyally split it out into Volume 4 of the manuals.

Naming Caveat : architectural MSRs were given the prefix "IA32_". However, it's not specific limited to 32 bits execution.

Using the instructions ```RDMSR``` and ```WRMSR```, the instruction can only be run in kernel mode.

```UA32_EFER``` is the Extended Feature Enables. The bit 8 (LME -- Long Mode Enable) is used to go from protected mode into 64-bit mode. The bit 10 (LMA) telling us if the mode is active right now or not. 

### Segmentation
Segmentation provides a mechanism of isolating individual code, data, and stack modules so that multiple programs (or tasks) can run on the same processor without interfering with one another. Paging provides a mechanism for implementing a conventional demand-paged, virtual-memory system where sections of a program’s execution environment are mapped into physical memory as needed. Paging can also be used to provide isolation between multiple tasks. When operating in protected mode, some form of segmentation must be used. There is no mode bit to disable segmentation. The use of paging, however, is optional.

We are going to use a logical address to locate a byte in a particular segment. A logical address consists of a segment selector and an offset. The physical address space is defined as the range of addresses that the processor can generate on its address bus. Linear address space is a flat 64 bit space.

- **32 bit Near Pointer vs Far Pointer**
A Far Pointer is a 32 bit value with a selector put in a front of it 1(16bit value).

- **64 bit Near Pointer vs Far Pointer**
A Far Pointer is a 64 bit Near Pointer value with a 16 bit Segment Selector.

Segmentation translates logical addresses to linear addresses, automatically, in hardware, by using table lookups. But software fills in the tables. Logical address (far pointer) = 16 bit segment selector + 32/64 bit offset.

If paging is not used, the processor maps the linear address directly to a physical address (that is, the linear address goes out on the processor’s address bus). If the linear address space is paged, a second level of address translation is used to translate the linear address into a physical address.

To translate a logical address into a linear address, the processor does the following:
1. Uses the offset in the segment selector to locate the segment descriptor for the segment in the GDT or LDT and reads it into the processor. (This step is needed only when a new segment selector is loaded into a segment register.)
2. Examines the segment descriptor to check the access rights and range of the segment to ensure that the segment is accessible and that the offset is within the limits of the segment.
3. Adds the base address of the segment from the segment descriptor to the offset to form a linear address.

A segment selector is a 16-bit identifier for a segment (see Figure 3-6). It does not point directly to the segment, but instead points to the segment descriptor that defines the segment.

- **Basic Flat Model**
The simplest memory model for a system is the basic “flat model,” in which the operating system and application programs have access to a continuous, unsegmented address space. To the greatest extent possible, this basic flat model hides the segmentation mechanism of the architecture from both the system designer and the application programmer.

![](imgs/20241117035626.png)

To implement a basic flat memory model with the IA-32 architecture, at least two segment descriptors must be created, one for referencing a code segment and one for referencing a data segment (see Figure 3-2). Both of these segments, however, are mapped to the entire linear address space: that is, both segment descriptors have the same base address value of 0 and the same segment limit of 4 GBytes. By setting the segment limit to 4 GBytes, the segmentation mechanism is kept from generating exceptions for out of limit memory references, even if no physical memory resides at a particular address. ROM (EPROM) is generally located at the top of the physical address space, because the processor begins execution at FFFF_FFF0H. RAM (DRAM) is placed at the bottom of the address space because the initial base address for the DS data segment after reset initialization is 0.


- **Protected Flat Model**
The protected flat model is similar to the basic flat model, except the segment limits are set to include only the range of addresses for which physical memory actually exists (see Figure 3-3). A general-protection exception (#GP) is then generated on any attempt to access nonexistent memory. This model provides a minimum level of hardware protection against some kinds of program bugs.
